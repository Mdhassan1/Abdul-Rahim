    <p>Johnny Depp was born June 9, 1963 in Owensboro, Kentuky. In his young years Johnny wanted to become a musician. He even played in the band. 
        But his musical carrier was not as successful as his actor one.
        After several small roles Depp landed his first legitimate movie role in the horror film ‚ÄúNightmare of Elm Street‚Äù. 
        The film had a great success.
        In 1990 Depp starred in the 50s-kitsch musical, Cry-Baby, which became a cult hit and succeeded in changing his image.
         At the same year Depp exhibited his versatility as an actor in the title role of Edward Scissorhands.
        Johnny Depp played many interesting roles but my favorite character is Captain Jack Sparrow from the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean.
         In 2004 Depp earned an Academy Award nomination for his starring role as Captain Jack Sparrow.
        Initially, Jack Sparrow was supposed to be a comic hero, an eternal loser who is completely sure in his irresistibility.
         But in the preparatory process and during the work on the film Jack‚Äôs character has changed. It happened thanks to Depp.
          He added to the image of Jack some features characteristic of rock musicians of the late twentieth century. 
          No one knows if the real pirates behaved like this but playing this role Depp took an example of a few rock stars.
           ¬´I‚Äôm alive!¬ª-¬ªI‚Äôm alive!¬ª-is the line of one of the rock song and motto of many rockers. The same can be said about Jack Sparrow. 
           Sense of existence, diversity of the world is perhaps the key characteristics of Jack Sparrow.
        To my point of view Johnny Depp is the most fascinating actor today. I advice to watch his movies to everybody who enjoys and evaluates good acting.</p>
